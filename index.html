<p>As a high school student journalist, I've read many incredible books about the journalism industry.  Some of them include textbooks found in university bookstores, novels on certain experiences, as well as biographies of journalists.  All of these books are quintessential if you are going into the profession or are currently in it and want to learn some history.  These are all phenomenal reads in their own special way.  Here are some of my favorite journalism books.</p>
<h2>"Sound Reporting: The NPR Guide to Audio Journalism and Production" by Jonathan Kern</h2>

<h2>"A Reporter's Life" by Walter Cronkite</h2>
<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348922423l/1039348.jpg">
<p>Synopsis (via the New York Times): "Walter Cronkite is a colorless sort of television-news superstar, not as good looking as Tom Brokaw or as polished as Peter Jennings or as edgy as Dan Rather. By his own account in ''A Reporter's Life,'' he dashed around a lot as a war correspondent yet never cut a dashing figure. For his millions of fans, this pilot, race-car driver and yachtsman was a pipe-smoking sort of guy, with a reassuring baritone and a steady manner in shaky years."</p>
