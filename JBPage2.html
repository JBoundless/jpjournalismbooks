<h2>"Muckraking! The Journalism That Changed America" by Judith & William Serrin</h2>
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dKCL07VjL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">
<p>Synopsis (via Amazon): In collecting the kind of reportage that all too rarely appears in this age of media triviality and corporate conglomeration, Muckraking! documents an alternative journalistic tradition, one marked by depth of vision, passion for change, and bravery. From the Stamp Act to the abolition movement to the Vietnam war, from the fight against patent medicines to the elimination of labor spies, from the integration of baseball to the safety of government atomic workers, and from putting people in jail to getting them out, this book illustrates the great journalism that has made America a better country.</p>

<h6>"The Journalist and the Murderer" by Janet Malcolm</h6>
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Vl6ubwhVL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">
<p>Synopsis (via Amazon): A seminal work and examination of the psychopathology of journalism. Using a strange and unprecedented lawsuit as her larger-than-life example -- the lawsuit of Jeffrey MacDonald, a convicted murderer, against Joe McGinniss, the author of Fatal Vision, a book about the crime -- she delves into the always uneasy, sometimes tragic relationship that exists between journalist and subject. In Malcolm's view, neither journalist nor subject can avoid the moral impasse that is built into the journalistic situation. When the text first appeared, as a two-part article in The New Yorker, its thesis seemed so radical and its irony so pitiless that journalists across the country reacted as if stung.</p>
